## Platforms

### LeetCode

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a popular online platform for coding practice. It offers a variety of problems categorized by difficulty and topic. Our solutions for LeetCode problems can be found in the [this directory](https://github.com/shitu13/DSA-Practice/tree/main/Array).

### Codeforces

[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) is a competitive programming platform that hosts contests regularly. It provides a wide range of challenging problems. Solutions to Codeforces problems are available in [this directory](https://github.com/shitu13/CodeForces_solutions).

### HackerRank

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is another platform for practicing coding problems and participating in contests. Solutions to HackerRank problems are stored in [this directory](https://github.com/shitu13/HackerRank_solutions).
## Data Structures

### Arrays

Arrays are a fundamental data structure used to store elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. Check out my array implementations and problem solutions in  [this directory](https://github.com/shitu13/DSA-Practice/tree/main/Array).

### Linked Lists

Linked lists are linear data structures where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element points to the next. Visit [this directory](https://github.com/shitu13/DSA-Practice/tree/main/LinkedListy)for implementations and problems.

### Stacks and Queues

Stacks and queues are abstract data types that follow specific order principles (LIFO for stacks and FIFO for queues). Explore our implementations in [this directory](https://github.com/shitu13/DSA-Practice/tree/main/StackAndQueue).

### Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures with nodes connected by edges. [This directory](https://github.com/shitu13/DSA-Practice/tree/main/Tree) contains various tree implementations and related problems.

### Graphs

Graphs consist of vertices connected by edges and are used to represent networks. Our graph implementations and problem solutions are in the `DataStructures/Graphs` directory.

### Heaps

Heaps are specialized tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property. Find our heap implementations in the `DataStructures/Heaps` directory.

### Hash Tables

Hash tables store key-value pairs and provide fast data retrieval. Check out our hash table implementations in [this directory](https://github.com/shitu13/DSA-Practice/tree/main/HashMap).

## Algorithms

### Sorting

Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a particular order. My implementations of various sorting algorithms can be found in [this directory](https://github.com/shitu13/DSA-Practice/tree/main/Sorting).

### Searching

Searching algorithms are used to find elements within data structures. Visit [this directory](https://github.com/shitu13/DSA-Practice/tree/main/Searching) for different searching techniques.

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. Our dynamic programming solutions are in [this directory]().

### Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms make local optimal choices at each step. Find our greedy algorithm solutions in the `Algorithms/GreedyAlgorithms` directory.

### Backtracking

Backtracking is a technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally. Our backtracking solutions are in the `Algorithms/Backtracking` directory.

### Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms deal with the properties and structures of graphs. Explore our graph algorithm solutions in the `Algorithms/GraphAlgorithms` directory.

### String Algorithms

String algorithms are used to solve problems related to strings. Check out our solutions in the `Algorithms/StringAlgorithms` directory.
