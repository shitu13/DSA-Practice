Leetcode 73. Set Matrix Zeroes
Approach (Using two extra arrays)
Time Complexity: O(2*(N*M)), where N = no. of rows in the matrix and M = no. of columns in the matrix.
Reason: We are traversing the entire matrix 2 times and each traversal is taking O(N*M) time complexity.

Space Complexity: O(N) + O(M), where N = no. of rows in the matrix and M = no. of columns in the matrix.
Reason: O(N) is for using the row array and O(M) is for using the col array.
